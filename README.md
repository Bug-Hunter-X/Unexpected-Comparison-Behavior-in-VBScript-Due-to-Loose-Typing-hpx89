This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, error in VBScript related to loose typing.  The script contains a function that compares two values.  However, if the function receives parameters of different data types, the comparison operation does not work as expected. The solution shows how to explicitly check data types before performing comparisons or utilize functions that handle such comparisons effectively.
